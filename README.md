**Version: 2.7**<br>
**Date: 09/14/2019**


## Description
A tool for simulating CNVs for WES data. It simulates rearranged genomes, short reads (fastq) and bam files automatically in one single command as desired by the user. There are several ways and distributions to choose from to generate desired CNVs.
Custom codes and algorithms were used to simulate rearranged genomes.
Short read simulation is based on the modified script of [Wessim1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624799/).
The error model is constructed using a modified script of [GimSIM](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-74).
BAM file generation uses [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/).

## Version 2.7 Update (09/14/2019):
* Updated the default error profile. Now it is Illumina HiSeq 2500 WXS paired end sequencing. The statistical reports for this error profile is also included.
* Included the modified scripts from [GimSIM](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-74) and instructions on how to make user-specific error profiles and generate statistical reports for the error profiles.

## Version 2.6 Update (08/31/2019):
* Users now can choose to only randomly replace gap regions (minimum length for defining the gap can be determined by the user), replace all "N"s or doesn't do any replacement.
* Users now can choose to only avoid gap regions (minimum length for defining the gap can be determined by the user), avoid all "N"s or doesn't avoid any "N"s.
* The control genome file randomly replaced "N"s/gap regions is now in the output directory with name "control.fa", instead of overwritting the original reference genome file.
* Modified the functions of SNP simulation to increase speed.
* Bug fixes.

## Version 2.5 Update (08/21/2019):
* Added an option to add slack regions up and down stream of target regions to simulate SNPs.
* The random simulation for SNPs is now weighted.
* Modified the functions of SNP and indel simulation to increase speed.
* Bug fixes.

## Version 2.4 Update (07/30/2019):
* Added indel simulation.

## Version 2.3 Update (07/16/2019):
* Changed SNP simulation from simulating on the whole genome to only in the target regions, which highly increase the speed.

## Version 2.2 Update (06/28/2019):
* Incorporated "replaceNs.py" to the main program as an option "-rN". No longer need to use "replaceNs.py" separately.
* Bug fixes.

## Version 2.1 Update (06/07/2019):
* Added Beta distribution for CNV length. User can define alpha and beta.
* User can now define mu and sigma for Gaussian distribution.
* Added feature: SNP simulation.
* Bug fixes.

## Version 2.0 Update (05/23/2019):
* Use a modified script of Wessim1 instead of ART_illumina to simulate short reads. This enables GC filtration in the step of short read generation. The modification of Wessim's script fixed the following issues in Wessim1:<br>
&#160;1) Only generate short reads at the start and end of each region, no reads generated in the middle of the regions.<br>
&#160;2) Can't read in the first line of the bed file with no header.<br>
&#160;3) The length of each region was 1 bp less than it should be.<br>
* Also, after modification Wessim1 doesn't require the genome to be indexed by "faidx", doesn't need python package "pysam", and the intermediate files can now be deleted automatically.

## Inputs
1. Sequence of a reference genome in fasta format. Anything after "_" or " " at header line will be ignored.
2. A tab delimited file of target regions in the order of chromosome, start and end. Header should not be included. Chromosome name should strictly match chromosome name in (1). Target regions should be sorted in ascending order.
3. For -e_cnv and -o_cnv, a tab delimited file generated by SimulateCNVs, in the order of chromosome, start, end, length and copy number. Header should be included. Chromosome name should strictly match chromosome name in (1).
4. For -e_cl and -o_cl, a tab delimited file of desired CNV lengths in the order of chromosome, CNV length and number of CNV of that length. Header should not be included. Chromosome name should strictly match chromosome name in (1).

## Outputs
1. Rearranged genome(s) (fasta)<br>
Control genome (fasta)<br>
2. List(s) of CNVs overlapping with target regions (bed)<br>
List(s) of CNVs outside of target regions (bed)<br>
3. Target regions for generating short reads for test(s) and control (\*.target_regions_for_gen_short_reads.bed). These rearranged target regions are for read generation ONLY. If don't want to use modified Wessim1, these can be used to extract target sequences and generate short reads by other read simulation tools like Wessim2 or ART_illumina (custom codes will be required for this, see [SimulateCNVs v1.0](https://github.com/YJulyXing/SimulateCNVs) which used a custom script to utilize ART_illumina). <strong>For CNV calling, the original target region file in input (2) should be used.</strong><br>
4. Short reads for rearranged genome(s) (fastq, if -ssr is chosen)<br>
Short reads for control genome (fastq, if -sc and -ssr is chosen)
5. Indexes for the control genome (.dict, .fai, .sa, etc., if -ssr and -sb is chosen and no indexes exist in the output directory)
6. BAM file(s) and index(es) for rearranged genome(s) (bam and bai, if -ssr and -sb is chosen)<br>
BAM file(s) and index(es) for control genome (bam and bai, if -sc, -ssr and -sb is chosen)

## Find parameters for Beta distribution from a set of known CNV lengths using R
* Use "fitdistr" in MASS library:
```
# x is an vector of CNV lengths, used to estimate parameters for Beta distribution.
x = c(10,20,30,40,35,25,11,37)
xs = (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
xs = xs[-which.max(x)]
xs = xs[-which.min(x)]

library(MASS)
fit=fitdistr(xs, "beta", list(shape1 = 0.5, shape2= 0.5))
print(fit)
```

* Or use "fitdist" in fitdistrplus library:
```
# x is an vector of CNV lengths, used to estimate parameters for Beta distribution.
x = c(10,20,30,40,35,25,11,37)
xs = (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
xs = xs[-which.max(x)]
xs = xs[-which.min(x)]

library(fitdistrplus)
fit <- fitdist(xs, "beta")
print(fit)
# To check fitness:
plot(fit, las = 1)
```

* Shape1 is alpha an shape2 is beta, which can be used in Beta distribution in SECNVs.

## Make user-specific error profiles
### To generate error model:
``` bash
python ~/SECNVs/GemSIM/GemErrxy.py \
      -r <maximium read length> \
      -f <reference genome (fasta)> \
      -s <SAM file for making error model with> \
      -n <prefix of error model> \
      -p
```
* Use "-p" only when data is paired!
* For extra options, see GimSIM manual

### To generate statistical reports:
``` bash
python ~/SECNVs/GemSIM/GemStats.py \
      -m <error model file name> \
      -n <prefix of the reports> \
      -p
```
* Use "-p" only when data is paired!

## Change SNP mutation rate
1. Open "snp_rate.py".
2. On line 14-18, find:
``` bash
"A": list(choices(["C","T","G"],1,p=[0.14, 0.04, 0.82])),
"T": list(choices(["C","A","G"],1,p=[0.84, 0.03, 0.13])),
"G": list(choices(["C","A","T"],1,p=[0.19, 0.7, 0.11])),
"C": list(choices(["G","A","T"],1,p=[0.17, 0.12, 0.71])),
```
The mutation rate from "A" to "C", "T" or "G" are the first, second and third numbers in p=[0.14, 0.04, 0.82] on "A" line, respectively. Change these numbers according to your need.
The mutation rate from "T" to "C", "A" or "G" are the first, second and third numbers in p=[0.84, 0.03, 0.13] on "T" line, respectively. Change these numbers according to your need.
The mutation rate from "G" to "C", "A" or "T" are the first, second and third numbers in p=[0.19, 0.7, 0.11] on "G" line, respectively. Change these numbers according to your need.
The mutation rate from "C" to "G", "A" or "T" are the first, second and third numbers in p=[0.17, 0.12, 0.71] on "C" line, respectively. Change these numbers according to your need.
3. Save "snp_rate.py".

## Examples
1. Simulate 10 CNVs overlapping with target regions, and 1 CNV outside of target regions randomly on each chromosome using default lengths, copy numbers, minimum distance between each of the 2 CNVs and proportion of insertions. For each CNV overlapping with target regions, the overlapping length is no less than 90 bps. CNV break points follow a Gaussian(1, 2) distribution, and CNV lengths follow a Beta(2, 5) distribution. CNVs are not generated in gaps. A total of 5 test and control samples are built. Short reads (fastq) files are generated using default settings, paired-end sequencing.
``` bash
SECNVs/SECNVs.py -G <input_fasta> -T <target_region> -o <output_dir> \
                  -e_chr 10 -o_chr 1 -ol 90 -ms gauss -as 1 -bs 2 -ml beta -al 2 -bl 5 -eN gap -n 5 -sc -pr -ssr
```

2. Simulate CNVs overlapping with target regions from a provided CNV list. Twenty CNVs are to be simulated outside of target regions randomly on the whole genome with default settings. CNVs are not to be generated on any stretches of "N"s. A pair of test and control genome are built.
``` bash
SECNVs/SECNVs.py -G <input_fasta> -T <target_region> -o <output_dir> \
                  -e_cnv <list_of_CNV_overlapping_with_target_regions> -o_tol 20 -eN all -sc
```

3.	Simulate 20 CNVs overlapping with target regions on the whole genome, and have at least 100 bps between any 2 CNVs. CNVs are not generated outside of target regions. Gaps (50 or more consecutive "N"s) are replaced by random nucleotides. SNP rate is 0.001 and indel rate is 0.00001, and the maximum indel length is 100 bps. Paired-end sequencing reads with quality offset 35 are then produced. For a pair of test and control genomes BAM files are generated.
``` bash
SECNVs/SECNVs.py -G <input_fasta> -T <target_region> -o <output_dir> \
                  -e_tol 20 -f 100 -rN gap -sc -pr -q 35 -ssr -sb \
                  -s_r 0.001 -i_r 0.00001 -i_mlen 100 \ 
                  -picard <absolute_path_to_picard> -GATK <absolute_path_to_GATK>
```

4.	Simulate CNVs overlapping with target regions and outside of target regions from provided files of CNV lengths. Combined single regions are formed from two or more regions originally separated by less than 100 bps. CNVs are not generated on gaps (60 or more consecutive "N"s). A total of 10 test and control samples are built. The paired-end sequencing must include sequences 50 bp upstream and downstream of the target regions. The final output consists of short reads (fastq) files with 100,000 reads.
``` bash
SECNVs/SECNVs.py -G <input_fasta> -T <target_region> -o <output_dir> \
                  -ml user -e_cl <length_file_1> -o_cl <length_file_2> \
                  -clr 100 -eN gap -n_gap 60 -n 10 -sc -pr -tf 50 -nr 100000 -ssr 
```
